#Prevent-A-Dent-Project
 is mainly about a garage sensor with two seven segments displays that shows the distance in inches. 
You can mount the sensor on a mailbox, and the displays mounted  somwhere easy to look inside the garage.
For this project my team and I managed to sperate the ultrasound sensor from the seven segements displays into two circuits using NRF24L01 radios.
