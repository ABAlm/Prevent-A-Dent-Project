#Prevent-A-Dent-Project is mainly about a garage sensor with continuous display that shows the distance in inches. 
You can mount the sensor on a mailbox, and the displays mounted  somwhere easy to look at inside the garage.
Having this project in your warehouse could help you prevent any cosmetic damages. 
For this project my team and I managed to sperate the ultrasound sensor from the seven segements displays into two circuits using NRF24L01 radios.
